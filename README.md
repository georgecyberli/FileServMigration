<h1>Legacy File Servers Migration and Security Enhancement Project</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
Project involved upgrading three critical virtual file servers from Windows Server 2008 and 2012 R2 to Windows Server 2022. Due to in-house limitations, new virtual servers were deployed, and data was seamlessly migrated using Robocopy for efficiency and security. This effort showcases expertise in infrastructure upgrades, emphasizing a commitment to technological advancement and operational efficiency for enhanced organizational performance.

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- Command Prompt
- Robocopy

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows Server 2022</b>

<h2>Project Summary:</h2>

<h3>Server 1: Windows Server 2008 to Windows Server 2022</h3>

<b>Incompatibility with SentinelOne:</b>

- Existing Windows Server 2008 is incompatible with our newest next-generation antivirus, SentinelOne. Upgrading to Windows Server 2022 ensures seamless integration with SentinelOne, enhancing our defense against emerging threats.

<b>Mimikatz Attack Vulnerability:</b>

- Windows Server 2008 lacks compatibility with security settings against the Mimikatz attack. A previous security incident, involving Mimikatz, affected several of our workspace computers.
- Upgrading to Windows Server 2022 provides advanced security features, mitigating the risk of Mimikatz attacks.

<b>Outdated and Unsupported:</b>

- The server has exceeded a decade in service, and Microsoft officially discontinued support for Windows Server 2008 many years ago.
- Operating an unsupported system exposes the organization to significant security vulnerabilities, warranting an immediate upgrade to ensure robust security measures.
<br />

<h3>Server 2: Windows Server 2012 R2 to Windows Server 2022</h3>

<b>End of Support for Windows Server 2012 R2:</b>

- Microsoft has declared the end of support for Windows Server 2012 R2 on October 10th, 2023.
- The continued use of an unsupported system poses a considerable security risk, with no future updates or patches available.

<b>Folder Access Control Issues:</b>

- The server suffers from a lack of folder access controls, allowing unrestricted access to all folders, including sensitive HR data.
- Upgrading to Windows Server 2022 addresses this critical access control issue, providing enhanced security measures to restrict folder access based on user roles and permissions.
<br />

<h3>Server 3: Windows Server 2012 R2 to Windows Server 2022</h3>

<b>Corrupted Operating System and Data Loss Risk:</b>

- The server is experiencing a degraded state with a corrupted operating system.
- The corrupted system poses a significant risk of data loss during server shutdown or reboot, requiring frequent data recovery from backups.
- Upgrading to Windows Server 2022 resolves the stability issues, eliminating the need for constant data recovery and ensuring the integrity of stored files.
